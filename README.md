# Email Spam Detector

This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting spam emails using Jupyter Notebook. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and the application of various machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or not spam.

## Features

- **Jupyter Notebook Based**: All code and analysis are provided in interactive notebooks for easy exploration and experimentation.
- **Spam Detection**: Utilizes machine learning techniques to automatically classify emails.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing raw email data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares performance of different models to identify the best spam detector.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Recommended: Install dependencies via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SaadZaidi1/Email-Spam-Detector.git
    cd Email-Spam-Detector
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    > **Note:** If `requirements.txt` is not available, install standard data science libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the provided `.ipynb` file(s) and follow along.
